# Formatted Strings:

```python
#We need to use f letter (f-string) before opening the string quotes (single or double)
current_year = 2023
print("Current year is", current_year, ". Next year is", current_year + 1) # Bad Example
print(f"Current year is {current_year}. Next year is {current_year + 1}") # Good Example
```
