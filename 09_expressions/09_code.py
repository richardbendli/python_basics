#Expressions

#Expressions will allow us to define different situations on our program, that will give us back the value of True or False


#Expressions usually are going to be described with at least one of the following operators.

# ==    Equal
# !=    Not equal
# >	    Greater than
# <	    Less than
# >=    Greater than or equal to
# <=    Less than or equal to

print(5 == 5) #True
print(5 != 5) #False
print(5 > 5) #False
print(5 < 5) #False
print(5 >= 5) #True
print(5 <= 5) #True
